## 1 what is CV?

computer vision(CV)

**definition**

1. a scientific field that extract information out of digital images.
2. application: building algorithms that can understand the content of imagess and use it for other applications.

**history**

> The origins of CV go back to an MIT undergraduate summer project.[^1]

**problem**

## 2 human vision

CV -- Human vision

- sensing device
- interpreting device

[Hubel and Wiesel & the Neural Basis of Visual Perception - Knowing Neurons](http://knowingneurons.com/2014/10/29/hubel-and-wiesel-the-neural-basis-of-visual-perception/)

> Some specialized neurons fired only when the line was in a particular spot on the retina or if it had a certain orientation.

Dr. Hubel

> The brain can be stuied just as the kidney can.

**human visual system is good.**

- speed.
- fooling humans[^2]. don't always believe your eyes.
- context. Hunmans use context all the time to infer clues about images.

computers can not do it very well.

**Learn from nature**

Simulating human.

## 3 extracting information from images

- vision as a measurement device.
  - stereo cameras
  - stereo vision
- a source of semantic information
  - label objects
  - label the whole scene
  - recoginize people
  - recoginize actions, gestures, faces.
  - medical images contain lots of semantic information
